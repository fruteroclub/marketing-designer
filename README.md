## Core Workflow: Insight-to-Impact Loop

Every marketing challenge follows six phases:

1. **DISCOVER** — Clarify objectives, find the emotional truth
2. **DEFINE** — Single-Minded Proposition, OKRs, narrative framework
3. **IDEATE** — Multiple Big Ideas, evaluate against criteria
4. **PROTOTYPE** — Minimum viable assets, A/B test plans
5. **LAUNCH** — Execute, monitor, optimize
6. **LEARN** — Post-campaign analysis, extract reusable insights

## Frameworks Included

| Framework | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **StoryBrand (SB7)** | Brand messaging, sales narratives |
| **AIDA** | Landing pages, ad copy |
| **PAS** | Pain-point marketing |
| **AAARRR** | Full-funnel optimization |
| **Jobs-to-Be-Done** | Understanding WHY customers buy |
| **Cialdini's 7 Principles** | Conversion optimization |
| **OKRs** | Goal-setting |
| **RICE Scoring** | Prioritizing initiatives |

## Creative Principles

The skill follows **The Olson Method**:

1. Start with emotional truth, not features
2. Reject imitation — if it could belong to any brand, it belongs to no brand
3. Separate idea from execution
4. Be willing to start over
5. Empathy is strategic
6. Change the conversation

## Customization

Replace `references/frutero-context.md` with your own brand context file to tailor the skill to your company's voice, archetypes, and positioning.

## Triggers

The skill activates on keywords like: `improve copy`, `marketing strategy`, `creative brief`, `campaign concept`, `brand messaging`, `pitch deck`, `proposal review`, `tagline`, `value proposition`, `positioning`.
