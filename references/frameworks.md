## Creative & Narrative Frameworks

### StoryBrand (SB7)
**When to use:** Brand messaging, website copy, sales narratives

**Structure:**
1. **Character** — Customer is the hero (not your brand)
2. **Problem** — External, internal, and philosophical
3. **Guide** — Your brand (with empathy + authority)
4. **Plan** — Simple 3-step process
5. **Call to Action** — Direct and transitional
6. **Failure** — Stakes of not acting
7. **Success** — Transformation achieved

**One-liner formula:** `[Character] has a [problem]. Meet [guide] who gives them a [plan] and calls them to [action]. They avoid [failure] and achieve [success].`

---

### Hero's Journey
**When to use:** Brand films, origin stories, long-form transformation narratives

**12 Stages (simplified):**
1. Ordinary World → 2. Call to Adventure → 3. Refusal → 4. Meeting the Mentor → 5. Crossing the Threshold → 6. Tests & Allies → 7. Approach → 8. Ordeal → 9. Reward → 10. Road Back → 11. Resurrection → 12. Return with Elixir

**For marketing:** Focus on stages 1-5 (setup) and 9-12 (payoff). Customer = hero, Brand = mentor.

---

### AIDA
**When to use:** Top-of-funnel campaigns, landing pages, ad copy, email sequences

| Stage | Goal | Tactics |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Attention** | Stop the scroll | Bold headlines, striking visuals, pattern interrupts |
| **Interest** | Keep them reading | Relevant problems, curiosity gaps, "you" language |
| **Desire** | Make them want | Benefits, social proof, transformation vision |
| **Action** | Get the click | Clear CTA, urgency, friction reduction |

---

### PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution)
**When to use:** Mid-funnel content, pain-point marketing, short-form persuasion

1. **Problem:** Name their pain clearly
2. **Agitation:** Twist the knife — show consequences of inaction
3. **Solution:** Present your answer as the relief

**Example:**
- P: "Your hackathon sponsors disappear after the event."
- A: "Two weeks later, 95% of builders are gone. $50K spent, nothing to show."
- S: "Frutero is the persistent retention layer that keeps builders shipping."

---

### The Big Idea
**When to use:** Campaign concepting — finding the single unifying concept

**Criteria for a Big Idea:**
1. Expressible in one sentence
2. Rooted in a human truth
3. Unique to this brand
4. Extensible across all channels
5. Passes the "why would anyone care?" test

**Test:** Can you explain it to a stranger in an elevator? Would they remember it tomorrow?

---

## Analytical & Measurement Frameworks

### AAARRR (Pirate Metrics)
**When to use:** Full-funnel optimization, startup growth, identifying the weakest stage

| Stage | Metric Examples | Focus Question |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Awareness** | Impressions, reach | Do they know we exist? |
| **Acquisition** | Visits, signups | Do they show up? |
| **Activation** | First value moment | Do they get it? |
| **Revenue** | Purchase, subscription | Do they pay? |
| **Retention** | DAU/MAU, repeat purchase | Do they come back? |
| **Referral** | NPS, invite rate | Do they tell others? |

**Application:** Find the biggest drop-off. Fix that stage first.

---

### Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA)
**When to use:** Understanding which touchpoints drive conversion in digital journeys

| Model | How it Works | Best For |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| First-touch | 100% credit to first | Awareness campaigns |
| Last-touch | 100% credit to last | Direct response |
| Linear | Equal credit to all | Balanced view |
| Time-decay | More credit to recent | Long sales cycles |
| Position-based | 40/20/40 split | Balanced with emphasis |
| Data-driven | ML-based allocation | Scale with data |

---

### Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)
**When to use:** Strategic budget allocation across channels, capturing offline and long-term effects

**Inputs:** Spend by channel, sales/revenue, seasonality, external factors
**Output:** Marginal ROI by channel, optimal budget allocation

**When to use over MTA:** Offline channels, long-term brand effects, privacy-restricted environments

---

### A/B Testing (PICOT)
**When to use:** Validating specific hypotheses about creative, messaging, targeting, or UX

| Element | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **P**opulation | Who is being tested |
| **I**ntervention | What variant is being tested |
| **C**omparison | What it's tested against (control) |
| **O**utcome | Primary metric |
| **T**ime | Duration of test |

**Hypothesis format:** "Given [data], we believe [intervention] will impact [outcome] by [amount]."

---

### Cohort Analysis
**When to use:** Understanding behavior changes over time by acquisition period, channel, or behavior segment

**Common cohorts:**
- Acquisition date (weekly/monthly)
- Acquisition channel
- First product used
- Pricing tier

**Key insight:** Compare retention curves across cohorts to identify what's changing.

---

## Research & Insight Frameworks

### Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD)
**When to use:** Understanding WHY customers buy, positioning, competitive analysis, innovation

**Core insight:** People don't buy products. They hire products to make progress.

**Job statement format:** `When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].`

**Example:** "When I finish a hackathon, I want to keep builders engaged, so I can convert event spend into ecosystem growth."

**Forces of progress:**
- Push: Pain with current solution
- Pull: Attraction to new solution
- Anxiety: Fear of change
- Habit: Comfort with status quo

---

### Design Thinking
**When to use:** Tackling ambiguous problems, new market entry, experience redesign

**5 Stages:**
1. **Empathize** — Understand users deeply
2. **Define** — Frame the problem ("How Might We...")
3. **Ideate** — Generate many solutions
4. **Prototype** — Build to learn
5. **Test** — Learn from feedback

---

### Porter's Five Forces
**When to use:** Industry competitive analysis, strategic positioning

1. Competitive rivalry
2. Threat of new entrants
3. Threat of substitutes
4. Bargaining power of suppliers
5. Bargaining power of buyers

---

### Customer Persona Development
**When to use:** Audience definition, messaging targeting

**Components:**
- Demographics (age, location, role)
- Psychographics (values, beliefs, attitudes)
- Behaviors (media consumption, buying patterns)
- Jobs-to-Be-Done (functional, emotional, social)
- Objections and friction points

---

## Planning & Execution Frameworks

### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
**When to use:** Quarterly goal-setting, strategic alignment

**Structure:**
- 1 Objective (qualitative, inspiring)
- 2-4 Key Results (quantitative, measurable)

**Example:**
- O: Establish Frutero as LATAM's leading DevRel partner
- KR1: Close 3 new protocol contracts ($18K+ total)
- KR2: Achieve 70%+ hackathon success rate
- KR3: Grow builder network to 1,500+

---

### RICE Scoring
**When to use:** Prioritizing a diverse backlog of campaigns, experiments, initiatives

| Factor | Definition | Scale |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **R**each | How many people affected | # of users |
| **I**mpact | How much it moves the needle | 0.25 / 0.5 / 1 / 2 / 3 |
| **C**onfidence | How sure are we | % |
| **E**ffort | Person-months required | # |

**Formula:** `(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

---

### MoSCoW
**When to use:** Scoping campaign deliverables, sprint planning

- **Must have:** Non-negotiable (cap at 60% capacity)
- **Should have:** Important but not critical
- **Could have:** Nice to have
- **Won't have:** Explicitly out of scope

---

### Sprint-Based Execution
**When to use:** Campaign development in iterations

| **Commitment** | Get small yeses before big asks |
| **Social Proof** | Show others like them succeeding |
| **Authority** | Demonstrate expertise, credentials |
| **Liking** | Be relatable, find common ground |

### Aristotle's Rhetoric
**When to use:** Calibrating persuasion mix for audience and context

| **Pathos** | Emotion, empathy | Consumer, B2C, aspirational |
| **Logos** | Logic, evidence | B2B, high-consideration |

**Best practice:** All three present, but vary the lead based on audience.

---

### Dual-System Thinking (Kahneman)
**When to use:** Campaign design, UX optimization

| System | Type | Design For |
|--------|------|------------|
| **System 1** | Fast, automatic, emotional | Headlines, visuals, instant appeal |
| **System 2** | Slow, deliberate, logical | Details, comparisons, justification |

**Application:** Capture with System 1, convince with System 2, close with System 1.

---

### Conversion-Centered Design
**When to use:** Landing pages, signup flows, checkout optimization

**Principles:**
1. **Focus** — 1:1 attention ratio (one page, one goal)
2. **Clarity** — Clear value proposition above fold
3. **Congruence** — Ad-to-page message match
4. **Benefits** — Lead with outcomes, not features
5. **Contrast** — Make CTA visually dominant
6. **Trust** — Social proof, security signals
7. **Urgency** — Reason to act now
8. **Friction** — Remove every unnecessary step
