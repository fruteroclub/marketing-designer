# Marketing Designer Example Interactions

Three reference interactions demonstrating the skill in action.

## Example 1: Campaign Development

### User Request
"We're launching a new productivity app for remote workers. We need a launch campaign. Budget is $50K. Target is knowledge workers 25-45."

### Expert Response

Before building the full campaign, let me share the insight I'd build it on — then we'll work through strategy, creative, and measurement.

**The emotional truth:**
Remote workers don't have a productivity problem. They have a *boundaries* problem. The real job-to-be-done isn't "get more done" — it's "feel like I've done enough so I can stop." Every productivity tool promises efficiency. None of them promise permission.

**Strategic direction:**

*Objective:* Drive 10,000 app downloads in first 90 days at under $5 CAC.

*Key Results:*
- KR1: Achieve 10,000 downloads (minimum 6,000 organic)
- KR2: Reach 40% Day-7 retention rate among new users
- KR3: Achieve 3:1 earned-to-paid media ratio through shareability

*Single-Minded Proposition:* "[App name] doesn't help you do more. It helps you know when you've done enough."

**Three creative concepts:**

**1. "The Done Line"**
Campaign built around the concept of a visible finish line for your workday. Visual identity uses a literal line that appears across all creative, representing the boundary between work and life. Social content shows the line appearing across real remote work environments.

*Insight:* People don't need more tools — they need an endpoint.
*Extensibility:* Works across digital, OOH, product UI, merchandise.

**2. "Out of Office, In Your Life"**
Reframe productivity as presence. The campaign celebrates the moments that happen *after* you close the app. User-generated content engine asking people to share their post-work moments.

*Insight:* The real reward of productivity is time reclaimed.
*Trade-off:* Higher virality potential but softer sell.

**3. "The Anti-Hustle"**
Provocative positioning against hustle culture. Bold, opinion-driven creative that takes a stand: productivity isn't about doing more, it's about doing the right things and then stopping.

*Insight:* There's cultural fatigue with "always on" messaging.
*Trade-off:* High differentiation, higher brand risk, highest cultural resonance.

**My recommendation:** Concept 1, "The Done Line."

It's the most ownable, most visual, and most directly connected to the product's core value. It works across every channel. And the metaphor is simple enough to explain in two seconds but rich enough to build a brand around.

**Measurement framework:**
90-day plan in three sprints:
- Sprint 1 (weeks 1-4): Launch core creative, establish baselines, run initial A/B tests
- Sprint 2 (weeks 5-8): Optimize based on data, scale winners, launch UGC
- Sprint 3 (weeks 9-12): Full optimization, retargeting, conversion focus

Budget split: 40% paid social, 25% content/SEO, 20% influencer, 15% testing reserve.

## Example 2: Performance Analysis

### User Request
"Our email open rates dropped from 28% to 19% over the last quarter. What's going on?"

### Expert Response

A **9-point drop in open rates over one quarter is significant** — roughly a 32% decline in engagement. This isn't drift; it's a signal that something structural changed.

**Most likely culprits, ranked:**

**1. List hygiene deterioration (highest probability)**
If your list grew significantly without pruning inactive subscribers, the denominator grew faster than engaged openers.

*Diagnostic:* What percentage of your list hasn't opened in 90+ days? If over 40%, this is almost certainly a major contributor. A healthy list purge alone could recover 4-6 points.

**2. Send frequency or timing shift**
Did you increase email frequency? Fatigue follows frequency increases within 6-8 weeks.

*Diagnostic:* Check send cadence week-over-week against open rate trends. Look for the inflection point.

**3. Content-audience mismatch**
Run a cohort analysis: are open rates declining uniformly, or are specific segments dropping faster?
- If newer subscribers are opening at lower rates → acquisition channels may be attracting low-intent subscribers
- If veterans are declining → content has drifted from what originally attracted them

**4. Deliverability issues**
Check sender reputation score, spam complaint rates, inbox placement.

*Diagnostic:* A spike in spam complaints above 0.1% or domain reputation change can silently devastate open rates.

**Recommended action plan:**

*This week:*
- Segment list into active (opened in 90d), lapsed (90-180d), dormant (180d+)
- Check deliverability metrics
- Pull open rates by acquisition cohort

*Next sprint:*
- Run re-engagement sequence for lapsed segment
- A/B test subject lines on active segment to establish new baseline

*This quarter:*
- Implement automated sunset policy — subscribers who don't open in 120 days get re-engagement, then suppression

**Expected outcome:** The 28% was likely your "real" engaged rate. The 19% is the same engaged audience diluted by a growing inactive tail. After pruning and re-engagement, expect recovery to 24-26% within 2-3 sends.

## Example 3: Strategy Review

### User Request
"Our CEO wants us to 'be more like Apple' in our marketing. We're a B2B SaaS company with $5M ARR."

### Expert Response

Your CEO is asking for the right thing using the wrong reference point. What they actually want — and what Apple actually does — is worth unpacking, because the surface-level interpretation ("make sleek ads") will waste your budget. The deeper interpretation could transform your positioning.

**What "be like Apple" actually means strategically:**

Apple doesn't market products. Apple markets *identity*. When someone buys a MacBook, they're not buying a laptop — they're buying membership in a tribe of creative, discerning people. The product is proof of the story, not the other way around.

**Three things you CAN learn from Apple:**

**1. Radical simplicity in messaging**
Apple describes what a product *does for you*, never how it works.

At $5M ARR, your biggest marketing problem is almost certainly that your messaging requires too many calories to understand. Can you explain your product's value in 6 words or fewer? If not, that's job one — and it's the most "Apple" thing you can do.

**2. A point of view, not a feature list**
Apple takes positions: privacy matters, creativity is essential, simplicity is superior.

What is your company's point of view about your market? Not features — your *belief* about how your category should work. That belief becomes your brand platform.

**3. Experience consistency across every touchpoint**
Apple's website, packaging, store, and support all feel like the same entity.

For a $5M B2B SaaS, the equivalent: Does your marketing site feel like your product? Does your onboarding feel like your sales process? Does support feel like your brand?

**What I'd actually recommend:**

Instead of "be like Apple," set an OKR that captures the real intent:

*Objective:* Establish a differentiated brand position that makes our value proposition instantly clear and memorable.

*Key Results:*
- KR1: Reduce homepage bounce rate by 25% (clearer messaging)
- KR2: Increase demo request conversion from 2% to 4% (stronger value prop)
- KR3: Achieve 60+ NPS among customers (experience consistency)

**Proposed path forward:**
A 90-day brand clarity sprint:
1. Messaging architecture (weeks 1-3)
2. Website and key-touchpoint redesign (weeks 4-8)
3. Refreshed campaign approach (weeks 9-12)

The investment is primarily strategic work and copywriting — not trying to outspend Apple on production values.
