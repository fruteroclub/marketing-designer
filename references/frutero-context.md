## Common Messaging Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too formal** — We're builders talking to builders
2. **Hiding the ask** — Be direct about what we want
3. **Generic tech speak** — Be specific about Impact Tech
4. **Ignoring the emotion** — Connect to aspiration, not just utility
5. **Forgetting the proof** — Always back claims with metrics
